# Air Bladder — a Cairn 2e game system for Foundry VTT

**Tracked, and this repo is public** — so read it as candid working notes, not as
documentation. It records deliberate deviations, things that turned out wrong, and
what each mistake cost, because that is what stops the same ground being re-argued.
Anything a *user* needs belongs in `README.md`; anything a contributor needs to
follow a process belongs in `docs/` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

It was untracked until 2026-07-29, on the reasoning that candid notes should not be
published. Tracking it wins on two counts: it was backed up nowhere, and a
contributor could not see the decisions their PR would run into.

A Foundry VTT **game system** (not a module) implementing Cairn 2e, an OSR TTRPG
by Yochai Gal. Published at `domfortunato/air-bladder`, installed from the release
manifest. Descends architecturally from a private fork of
`yochaigal/Cairn-FoundryVTT` (still on this machine at
`c:\Users\domin\code\Cairn-FoundryVTT`), but is an independent system with its own
`id`, content and history — **not** a fork in git terms.

## Version reality

- **Deploy target is Foundry 14.365.** `system.json` declares
  `compatibility: {minimum: "14", verified: "14"}`. Raised from 13 on 2026-07-29:
  the AppV2 sheets use `_getFrameButtons`, `_canDetach` and `_onDetach`/`_onAttach`,
  all confirmed against the shipped 14.365 client and none of them verifiable on
  v13 from this machine. A minimum nobody has ever tested is a claim, not a fact.
- Latest release **0.1.7** (2026-07-28). `system.json`'s `version` is rewritten by
  CI from the git tag; don't trust the checked-in value.
- Node 24.x. `npm run release X.Y.Z` is the whole release — see `RELEASE.md`.

## Git: two branches, one direction

**`master` is the released state. `dev` is everything in progress.** All work —
features, fixes, docs, typos — goes on `dev`. `master` only ever receives a merge
from `dev` plus the release commit. `dev` is permanent: never renamed, never
deleted. Full model in `docs/git-flow.md`; contributor-facing summary in
`CONTRIBUTING.md`.

- **No hotfixes, by policy.** A released version is never patched; fixes ride the
  next release. That deletes this model's classic failure — a fix on `master` that
  never gets merged back.
- **Topic branches off `dev`** are for work that outlasts the release cadence *and*
  is broken in the middle — otherwise it holds every release hostage. Lowercase-kebab,
  merge `dev` in regularly, merge back at each releasable milestone, delete when done.
  Note CodeQL does not scan them.
- **Merge `master` into `dev` after every release.** The release commit bumps
  `system.json` on `master` only, so `dev` is behind by that line every time and the
  next merge conflicts on it. This is the only master→dev sync there is.
- **`npm run release` refuses to run off `master`** and prints the commits it is
  about to ship.
- **CodeQL scans `dev`** (`codeql-analysis.yml` triggers on both branches), so
  findings arrive while the code is still unreleased. *Pages* is master-only, so a
  site change on `dev` has no preview until the merge. To see what is queued:
  `/compare/master...dev`.
- **Never tag or release on GitHub.** `origin` (Gitea) push-mirrors to GitHub and
  force-syncs, so a GitHub-only ref is pruned and its release silently becomes a
  draft. Tag on `origin`. Same reason PRs are merged locally, never with GitHub's
  button — see `docs/i18n-maintainer.md`.
- Why bother: docs and the website track `master` while users install the tag, so
  work on `master` would publish documentation for features nobody can install. And
  `dev` mirrors to GitHub in seconds, so people can clone it and test unreleased
  code.

## Architecture

Entry point `module/cairn.js`, registering document classes and sheets on `init`.
~7,500 lines of JS across `module/`; everything else is content.

- `CairnActor` (`module/actor/actor.js`) — types `character`, `npc`, `container`,
  `hireling`
- `CairnItem` (`module/item/item.js`) — types `item`, `weapon`, `armor`,
  `spellbook`, `object`, `background`, `transport`
- `module/actor/actor-sheet.js` is the largest file
- `module/damage.js` holds Cairn's damage flow
- Data models in `module/data-models.js` (TypeDataModel; `template.json` is gone,
  sub-types are declared in `system.json` `documentTypes`); 22 compendium packs
- 23 GM settings in `module/settings.js` — **registration ORDER is load-bearing**,
  because Foundry's group headers are positional

## Deliberate deviations from Foundry practice

Listed so a review does not re-litigate them. If you disagree with one, argue
against the reason, not against the fact.

- ~~**Sheets are AppV1**~~ — **NO LONGER TRUE as of 2026-07-29.** Both sheets are
  ApplicationV2 (`HandlebarsApplicationMixin(ItemSheetV2 / ActorSheetV2)`), merged to
  `dev`; there is no AppV1 left in `module/`. **One jQuery call survives** —
  `damage.js:55` `$(event.currentTarget)`, in the chat Apply-damage button, which is
  not a sheet and which no probe exercises. This file claimed "no jQuery left" until
  2026-07-30; it was never true. This was the ONLY
  deviation with an externally-set expiry (AppV1 removal in **v16**, per the shipped
  client `appv1/api/application-v1.mjs:59-64` — not v15, which this file used to say), and
  it is now closed. Kept here only so nobody re-plans it.
  **Three things the port established that still govern the code:**
  - **Dark mode. The sheets follow the viewer's colour scheme** (settled 2026-07-28), and
    `css/cairn.css` opens with a light+dark token palette rather than literal colours
    assuming parchment. Gated by `npm run dev:theme`. Read **`docs/theming.md`** before
    touching a colour.
  - **AppV2 supplies neither `.window-content` scrolling nor AppV1's 8px padding nor
    `.window-content > * { flex: 1 }`**, and every sheet grid here was laid out against
    all three. They are restored explicitly at the top of `css/cairn.css` — do not
    "simplify" that block away. `npm run dev:sheet-layout` is the gate; it exists because
    losing them made the HP/Gold counters render on top of STR and Armor while the sheet
    still rendered, persisted every field, and logged zero console errors.
  - **`submitOnChange` must be declared and `submitOnClose` no longer exists.** AppV1's
    sheets set both; `DocumentSheetV2` defaults `submitOnChange: false`
    (`applications/api/document-sheet.mjs:65-68`) and has no `submitOnClose` at all. So
    "edit a field and it saves" is asked for explicitly, and closing a sheet no longer
    commits an un-blurred edit. The pack cache at the top of `actor-sheet.js` exists
    because `submitOnChange` re-runs `_prepareContext` on every committed keystroke.
  Traps, and what each cost: memory `air-bladder-appv2-migration`.
- **Containers and transports are Actors, not Items**, linked to their owner by a
  `uuid` field named `keeper` (named to dodge a Foundry collision). Against
  Foundry's grain and it needs manual bookkeeping. The reason is capacity:
  "+8 slots" cannot live on an Item — nothing reads `system.slots` on one. Expect
  bugs to cluster here.
- **No automation of mechanical text.** "Restores 1 STR" stays prose. Trust
  players; no macros, no buttons. House style, and it dissolves the hardest
  content cases (a background granting a statted homunculus is text, not a spawned
  Actor).
- **Content translation is a display-only overlay** keyed on the ENGLISH SOURCE
  STRING (`lang/content/<lang>.json`, `module/i18n-content.js`), not on ids.
  Consequence that bites: **editing an English description orphans its
  translation.** Weigh that before "fixing" pack prose.
- **Pack YAML in `src/packs/` is the source of truth**; `packs/` is generated
  LevelDB, gitignored. Never edit `packs/`. `npm run build:packs` fails while
  Foundry has the world open (LevelDB EPERM) — stop the server first.

## Rules encoded — these are the game, not bugs

- Damage minus armor hits HP; overflow spills into STR, then forces a STR save.
  STR at 0 is death.
- Armor is hard-capped at 3.
- Slot inventory: bulky = 2, weightless = 0, times quantity.
- **Being encumbered sets HP to 0 outright. So does panic.** Intentional.
- **Coins consume slots** (2e p.9): `ceil(gold/N) - 1` where N is the
  "coins per slot" setting. ONE rule for every actor type.
- **Dice notation overloads `+`.** `2d8` = add (2..16). `d8 + d8` = keep highest
  (1..8). `2d20 + 10` = arithmetic. The keep-highest rewrite applies only when
  every `+`-separated term is a bare die.

## Where intent is recorded

Commit messages. They are long and they explain *why* — treat `git log` as the
design record. `docs/` holds the durable plans (i18n, custom backgrounds,
translating). `README.md` carries credits and licensing.

## Four licences, not one

1. **Code — MIT.**
2. **Game text — CC BY-SA 4.0**, Yochai Gal. Attribution required; derivatives
   inherit ShareAlike. Includes the "Compatible with Cairn" badge in `logo/`.
3. **Character portrait/token art — CC BY 4.0**, Jon Aspeheim. Attribution only;
   confirmed human-made (no AI), credited in `README.md`.
4. **Item icons — CC BY 3.0**, game-icons.net. Per-icon author attribution is in
   `icons/CREDITS.md`, which must stay in step with the `ICONS` table in
   `tools/import/icons.mjs` — add a row to one, add a row to the other. Hand-adding
   an SVG instead of running the importer is how `stack.svg` shipped with no
   intrinsic size, rasterising at 150×150.
5. **The Air Bladder logo — all rights reserved**, Lydia Comer, used by bespoke
   grant. NOT a Creative Commons licence; do not treat it as one.

(Yes, that is five. The heading is inherited.)

## Testing

**`docs/release-testing.md` is the full list — 64 scripts, what each covers, and
what to run before tagging vs after publishing. Keep it in step with
`package.json`; a probe not listed there runs only when someone remembers it.**

- `npm run dev:smoke` — headless Chromium against the local dev world on :30000,
  which loads this working tree via a directory junction. Asserts the system
  loads, SHIPPED packs are non-empty (world packs are excluded — one of them is
  legitimately empty), a sheet renders, zero console errors.
- Offline, no Foundry: `check:refs`, `check:fields`, `check:traits`, `i18n:check`.
- **`system.json` `documentTypes.<Doc>.<subtype>.htmlFields` is a SECURITY control,
  not metadata.** The Foundry server never loads `module/data-models.js`, so an
  `HTMLField` missing from the manifest is never sanitized and a player can XSS the
  GM through their own character's notes. `check:fields` cross-checks the two, and
  `npm run dev:sanitize` proves it takes effect — the server reads `system.json`
  only at STARTUP, so an un-restarted edit looks exactly like no edit.
- **Three rules paid for the hard way.** A new test must be confirmed to FAIL with
  its fix removed. A test's precondition must not be satisfiable by stale world
  state — several assertions here once passed by reading an actor a previous
  aborted run had left behind. And a probe that fails once then passes on re-run is
  a **race, not a flake**; do not re-run and call it green.
